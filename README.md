# 🧠 Elite Arena - Server Side

Welcome to the **backend** of Elite Arena — the powerhouse behind a modern sports club experience.

This server handles all the core logic that makes the platform work:
- 🔐 Auth & Role Verification  
- 🏸 Court & Booking Management  
- 💳 Payments via Stripe (with coupons)  
- 📢 Announcements, Branches, and Profile APIs

While the server focuses on secure data and API handling, all user interactions and UI are managed from the client side.
